# Metro-Interstate-Traffic-Volume
In this project, we are analyzing the metro interstate traffic volume data.<br><br>
Using this dataset, we are trying to predict the traffic volume based on a number of factors. 
Since the same dataset will be used for Part A, B, and C, We will compare different models and test their performance.<br> <br>
In Part A, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the predictors and how they affect the traffic volume.
Next we will use Linear Regression to create a prediction model. The model will be based on Multiple Linear Regression. 
While implementing the prediction mode, we perform several methods for variable selection and model diagnostics.
Future points will then be forecasted using the selected model.<br><br>
In Part B, we compare different SARIMA models based on the ACF/PACF.
Using AIC and BIC as model selection criteria, a suitable model will be selected and residual analysis will be conducted. 
Future points will then be forecasted using the selected model.<br><br>
Finally, in Part C, Spectral Analysis and Neural Networks will be used to forecast future points.
